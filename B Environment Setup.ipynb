    "You can install Python directly on your computer. For data science, the Anaconda distribution is highly recommended because it includes many popular libraries (e.g., NumPy, pandas, matplotlib) and tools like Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "1. Install Python Locally\n",
    "    * Visit the [Anaconda downloads page](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual).\n",
    "    * Select the graphical installer for Python 3.12 compatible with your operating system.\n",
    "    * After installation, consider setting up a virtual environment to manage dependencies for individual projects.\n",
    "1. Use Docker (Recommended for This Class)\n",
    "    * Install Docker Desktop and pull an Anaconda-based Docker image. This lets you run your Python environment in a container, ensuring everyone uses the same reproducible setup.\n",
    "    * Docker containers include everything needed to run the code (e.g., Python, libraries, system tools).\n",
    "    * This ensures consistent environments across all students—for development and grading.\n",
    "    * Bonus: you'll gain valuable experience with Docker, a standard industry tool.\n",
    "1. Use a Cloud-Based Python Environment\n",
    "If you prefer not to install anything locally, you can run Python directly in your browser using cloud services:\n",

    "### What is Docker? \n",
    "From https://www.docker.com/why-docker:\n",
    "> In 2013, Docker introduced what would become the industry standard for containers. Containers are a standardized unit of software that allows developers to isolate their app from its environment, solving the “it works on my machine” headache. For millions of developers today, Docker is the de facto standard to build and share containerized apps - from desktop, to the cloud. We are building on our unique connected experience from code to cloud for developers and developer teams.\n",

    "\n",
    "From https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Docker_(software):\n",
    ">Docker is a set of platform as a service (PaaS) products that use OS-level virtualization to deliver software in packages called containers.[6] Containers are isolated from one another and bundle their own software, libraries and configuration files; they can communicate with each other through well-defined channels.[7] All containers are run by a single operating system kernel and therefore use fewer resources than virtual machines.[8] The service has both free and premium tiers. The software that hosts the containers is called Docker Engine.[8] It was first started in 2013 and is developed by Docker, Inc.[9]\n",

    "So why are we using Docker in this class? Here are a few reasons!\n",
    "1. Docker skills are in high demand right now. According to [hackerearth's list of top 9 hottest tech skills to hire for in 2020](https://www.hackerearth.com/blog/talent-assessment/hottest-tech-skills-to-hire/), Docker is number 6 on the list (while Python is number 2!). Here is [blog post](https://dev.to/javinpaul/11-essential-skills-software-developers-should-learn-in-2020-1bio) that lists Docker as the number one essential skill software developers should learn in 2020. For fun, do your own searching about Docker and how in demand it has become. Indeed shows that demand for Docker skills continues to surge, up 4,162% since 2014 and it was listed in more than 5% of all US tech jobs in 2019 (from [InfoWorld](https://www.infoworld.com/article/3583931/the-most-valuable-software-developer-skills.html))\n",
    "1. One of the most important concepts in data science is *reproducibility*, which is the notion of designing and documenting experiments that are reproducible. This means that you (and others) should be able to reproduce your results. Docker makes it easy to make your results reproducible because you can essentially save your tech stack (e.g. the exact versions of Python, its dependencies, etc.) and distribute it easily to others.\n",
    "1. In this class, we are going to test our code using *unit tests*. A unit test is a test that measures the correctness of one unit, such as a function or a class. With Docker, you can run your tests against your code locally with the *exact same* tech stack (e.g. Docker image) my automated testing setup will run. There won't be any discrepancies in the output of your code running in your Docker container versus my Docker container, so long as we are running containers from the exact same image!\n",
    "1. It is **FUN** to learn new things. In fact, a career in computer science and software development is a career in lifelong learning 🤓\n",

    "Basic Docker terminology you should know (adapted from Microsoft's [Docker terminology post](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/architecture/microservices/container-docker-introduction/docker-terminology) and https://mindmajix.com/docker/basic-terminologies-of-docker):\n",
    "* Container image: A package with all the dependencies and information needed to create a container (these dependencies are defined in a Dockerfile). An image includes all the dependencies (such as frameworks) plus deployment and execution configuration to be used by a container runtime. Usually, an image derives from multiple base images that are layers stacked on top of each other to form the container's file system. An image is immutable once it has been created. Below are the major features of a Docker image:\n",
    "    * Portability: The Docker images can easily be pushed or moved into a Docker registry and can also be saved as tar file.\n",
    "    * Layered nature: Images are added using layers. This enables re-usability of images and disk usability is highly reduced as the parent layers are shared.\n",
    "    * Static or Compile-time nature: Though you can create a new Docker image, the contents will remain unchanged.\n",
    "* Container: An instance of a Docker image. A container represents the execution of a single application, process, or service. It consists of the contents of a Docker image, an execution environment, and a standard set of instructions. When scaling a service, you create multiple instances of a container from the same image. Or a batch job can create multiple containers from the same image, passing different parameters to each instance.\n",
    "* Tag: A mark or label you can apply to images so that different images or versions of the same image (depending on the version number or the target environment) can be identified.\n",
    "* Repository (repo): A collection of related Docker images, labeled with a tag that indicates the image version. Some repos contain multiple variants of a specific image, such as an image containing SDKs (heavier), an image containing only runtimes (lighter), etc. Those variants can be marked with tags. A single repo can contain platform variants, such as a Linux image and a Windows image.\n",
    "* Registry: A service that provides access to repositories. The default registry for most public images is [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/) (owned by Docker as an organization). A registry usually contains repositories from multiple teams. Companies often have private registries to store and manage images they've created. Azure Container Registry is another example.\n",

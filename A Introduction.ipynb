    "## What is Data Science?\n",
    "\n",
    "Data science studies how to use data to solve problems and answer research questions. It combines statistics, computer science and domain knowledge.\n",
    "\n",
    "It constitutes all parts of a data-intensive workflow, from the beginning (e.g., data collection, data preparation), through the middle (e.g., data mining, supervised/unsupervised machine learning) to the end (e.g., presenting insights and/or deploying a software system). \n",

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As you can see in the image above, becoming proficient in data science requires a mix of hard skills and soft skills. A strong foundation in **statistics** and **mathematics** is essential for analyzing and visualizing data. At the core lies **machine learning**, the engine that powers predictions and intelligent systems. To apply machine learning effectively, you also need coding skills, from implementing algorithms to handling data preprocessing, model training, and evaluation. Equally important is a solid grasp of the **domain** you are working in, so you can frame business problems or research questions accurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "But technical expertise alone isn‚Äôt enough. Once you‚Äôve drawn conclusions or built models, you must be able to communicate your results clearly to stakeholders. Good communication ensures that your work has real-world impact.\n",
    "\n",
    "In short, data science covers the entire data-driven workflow‚Äîfrom the beginning (data collection and preparation), through the middle (data mining, supervised and unsupervised learning), all the way to the end (presenting insights or deploying systems).\n",
    "\n",
    "## Data Science Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "* Data Collection: Gathering the information you need from surveys, databases, sensors, or other sources. (This is where you get your raw data.)\n",
    "* Data Wrangling (Cleaning): Fixing messy data by handling missing values, formatting issues, and duplicates so it‚Äôs ready to use.\n",
    "* Data Exploration: Looking at the data closely to spot patterns, trends, or unusual points. (Sometimes called ‚Äúexploratory data analysis‚Äù or EDA.)\n",
    "* Modeling: Using statistical models or machine learning algorithms to make predictions or understand relationships in the data.\n",
    "* Visualization & Communication: Presenting your findings clearly using charts, dashboards, or reports, so others can understand and act on your results.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What are examples of data in the real-world and how is that data being analyzed?**\n",
    "* Medical data collected from electronic health records, physician/nurse notes, etc.\n",
    "    * Analyzed to determine health risk factors, onset of early disease, insurance billing, etc.\n",
    "* Time series data collected from sensors installed in the environment or worn on the body (wearables)\n",
    "    * Analyzed to detect physical activity, daily behavior, changes in behavior over time, etc.\n",
    "* Social media data collected from social networks, posting, news feeds, etc.\n",
    "    * Analyzed to suggest friends, deliver user-specific content, recommend products, target advertising, etc.\n",
    "* Financial data collected from banking transactions, trading, etc.\n",
    "    * Analyzed to project stock market trends, recommend certain investments, determine credit scores, etc.\n",

    "* [Data representation/cleaning/munging/wrangling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_wrangling): Describes the overall process of manipulating unstructured and/or messy data into a structured and clean form.\n",
    "* [Data mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_mining): The computational process of discovering patterns in large data sets involving methods at the intersection of artificial intelligence, machine learning, statistics, and database systems. The overall goal of the data mining process is to extract information from a data set and transform it into an understandable structure for further use.\n",
    "* [Machine learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_learning): Provides computers with the ability to learn without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning focuses on the development of computer programs that can change when exposed to new data."

    "## Python\n",
    "In this class, we are going to learn and use the Python programming language for all of our coding assignments. According to [IEEE Spectrum](https://spectrum.ieee.org/top-programming-languages-2022), Python is the top programming language and according to [KDNuggets](https://www.kdnuggets.com/2020/01/python-preferred-languages-data-science.html), Python is the most popular programming language for analytics, data mining, and data science (followed by R). \n",

    "1. Many supported GUI backends\n",
    "1. LOTS of community support/development online\n",
    "1. Cross platform support\n",

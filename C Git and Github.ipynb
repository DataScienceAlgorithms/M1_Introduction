    "## Overview\n",
    "This lesson is going to be a collection of online resources for learning about Git and Github. While it is important to learn the fundamentals of these tools by reading the following materials, the best way to learn is to actually play with these tools. Follow along on your own machine where appropriate.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Version Control\n",
    "From the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-About-Version-Control):\n",
    ">What is \"version control\", and why should you care? Version control is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later. \n",
    "\n",
    ">If you are a graphic or web designer and want to keep every version of an image or layout (which you would most certainly want to), a Version Control System (VCS) is a very wise thing to use. It allows you to revert files back to a previous state, revert the entire project back to a previous state, compare changes over time, see who last modified something that might be causing a problem, who introduced an issue and when, and more. Using a VCS also generally means that if you screw things up or lose files, you can easily recover. In addition, you get all this for very little overhead.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Git](https://git-scm.com) is a popular VCS that is the version control software that GitHub is built on. [GitHub](https://github.com/) is a code hosting platform for version control and collaboration. People from all over the world (or in the exact same place) can work together on projects. Code that is hosted on GitHub can be either public or private.\n",
    "\n",
    "## GitHub\n",
    "First, make a free [GitHub](https://github.com/) account.\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, follow this Hello World tutorial on Github: [https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/](https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/). This tutorial walks you through the following:\n",
    "1. Create a repository. A repository is a folder that organizes your GitHub project. Files and folders in your repository are version controlled. You should always include a README.md file in each of your repositories. README files are markdown files that describe your repository. Read more about README.md files [here](https://help.github.com/articles/about-readmes/). \n",
    "1. Create a branch. A branch is a version of the repository that someone is working on. The \"master\" branch of your repository is the main branch. When you are going to work on a new feature of the software, you will make a new branch off of the master branch. This new branch is a copy of the master branch. When you are done implementing your new feature, you merge your branch back into master.\n",
    "1. Create a commit. A commit is a change to file(s) in the repository that you want to save.\n",
    "1. Create a pull request. When you make a pull request, you are asking someone to pull in your proposed changes from your branch to be merged with another branch (usually master). \n",
    "1. Merge a pull request.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Common Git Command\n",
    "So far, we have been using GitHub via its browser interface for simple non-code edits. More commonly, you will be writing code locally on your machine. You will then want to push the code changes from your local repository to the repository on GitHub via a command line interface. To do this, we will use Git and Git commands.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, install Git onto your machine: [Installing Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git).\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, follow this Git/GitHub tutorial: http://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners. This tutorial walks you through the following (I’ve added example commands for working with a repository called FirstweekTest):\n",
    "### **Workflow 1: Start Locally**\n",
    "#### 1. Create a git repository (`init` command)\n",
    "* Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "echo \"# Test\" >> README.md \n",
    "git init\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 2. Stage a file (`git add`)\n",
    "Using the `add` command, this step tells Git which files you want to package into a commit. \n",
    "* Example: `git add README.md`\n",
    "* (or `git add -A` or `git add .` to add all files to staging area)\n",
    "#### 3. Create a commit (`git commit`).\n",
    "A `commit` is a snapshot of your code changes and includes descriptions of the changes. Each commit contains:\n",
    "* Author\n",
    "* Description message\n",
    "* Timestamp\n",
    "* Branches\n",
    "* Identifier\n",
    "   * Example: `git commit -m \"initial commit\"`\n",
    " \n",
    "#### 4. Create a branch (`git branch`). (optional)\n",
    "Branches allow you to work on features independently of the main code.\n",
    "* `main` (or `master`) branch: Production read code\n",
    "* Create a development branch to work on new features\n",
    "    * Example: `git branch development` (creates branch but you have to switch to it before working)\n",
    "    * `git checkout -b development` (creates a branch and switches to it immediately)\n",
    "* Merge development branch back into master when you are done implementing the new feature\n",
    "   * Example:\n",
    "```\n",
    "git checkout master\n",
    "git merge development\n",
    "```\n",
    "* Note: When you want to merge a feature branch into `main` (or `master`), you need to switch to the branch you want to merge into first, in this case, `master`\n",
    "#### 5. Create Github repo on Github website\n",
    "* Note: If planning to push existing local repo to remote\n",
    "        1. Don’t initialize with README or .gitignore or license \n",
    "        1. Otherwise you may need `git pull origin main --allow-unrelated-histories`\n",
    "* Note: If planning to clone remote repo to initialize local repo\n",
    "        1. Initialize with README and/or .gitignore and/or license\n",
    "        1. These will be copied down you clone\n",
    "#### 6. Add a local repository to GitHub (`git remote add`).\n",
    "Connect your local repo to a remote repo\n",
    "    1. Example: `git remote add origin https://github.com/sluitel2025/FirstweekTest.git`\n",
    "#### 7. Push local changes to GitHub (`git push`).\n",
    "Send your commits to the remote repository\n",
    "* Example: `git push -u origin master`\n",
    "\n",
    "### **Workflow 2: Start by Cloning a Remote Repo**\n",
    "\n",
    "#### 1. Clone remote Github repo to create local repo\n",
    "If you are starting from an existing remote repo \n",
    "* `git clone https://github.com/sluitel2025/FirstweekTest.git`\n",
    "*  Note: can only push to this repo if you have write privileges (e.g. you are owner/collaborator)\n",
    "#### 2. Make Changes/Edit files \n",
    "#### 3. Stage Files (`git add`)  \n",
    "#### 4. Create Commit (`git commit`)  \n",
    "#### 5. Create Branch (`git branch` or `git checkout -b`)  \n",
    "#### 6. Push Changes (`git push`)  \n",
    "  \n",
    "#### 7. Update your local repository with the most up to date code on GitHub (`git pull`).\n",
    "* When you want to sync with remote changes\n",
    "    \n",
    "\n",
    "### **Check Repository Status and History**\n",
    "- Check which files are staged, unstaged, or untracked: \n",
    "  `git status`  \n",
    "- View commit history with messages, author, and timestamps: \n",
    "  `git log`  \n",
    "- Check which branch you are currently on: \n",
    "  `git branch`  \n",
    "  - The current branch will be highlighted with a `*`.  \n",
    "Here is great graphic that summarizes the Git commands learned so far (no need to worry about most of these details for now).\n",

    "## Git Ignore Files\n",
    "Files that end in .gitignore contain rules for files/folders that git should ignore, meaning not put under version control. This is nice if you typically always add all files for staging (e.g. `git add -A` or `git add .`) instead of individual ones. Here are a few examples of files and folders you might want to have git ignore in this class:\n",

    "* DS_Store\n",
    "* .vscode\n",
    "\n",
    "Instead of creating a .gitignore file from scratch, head over to https://github.com/github/gitignore and find a standard .gitignore file for the kind of project/programming language you are working on. Then you can customize for your project. For this class, it is convenient to start with the Python.gitignore: https://github.com/github/gitignore/blob/master/Python.gitignore\n",
    "\n",
    "I recommend adding a .gitignore to your repository when you create it. Otherwise you'll have to remove files from git using `git rm --cached [filenames]` or `git rm -r --cached .` to remove all files. Then add the .gitignore file and you can add files for tracking again.\n",
